# 🔍 How to See Error Messages in Xcode

## Step 1: Open the Console in Xcode

1. **In Xcode**, look at the bottom of the window
2. You should see a **split view** with your code on top and panels at the bottom
3. If you don't see the bottom panel, click **View → Show Debug Area** (or press `Shift + Cmd + Y`)
4. The **console** is the bottom-right panel (it shows text output)

## Step 2: Find Error Messages

When you try to login/signup, look in the console for:
- Messages starting with `❌` (red X emoji)
- Messages starting with `⚠️` (warning emoji)
- Any text in red

## Step 3: If You Still Can't See Console

1. Click **View** in the menu bar
2. Click **Show Debug Area** (or press `Shift + Cmd + Y`)
3. You should see panels at the bottom
4. The right panel is the **console** - that's where errors appear

## Alternative: See Errors on Screen

I've also added error messages that show **directly on the login/signup screen**:
- Red error boxes appear at the top of the form
- Red snackbars appear at the bottom of the screen

Look for these when you try to login/signup!

## Quick Test

1. Try to login with any email/password
2. Look for:
   - **Red error box** at the top of the login form
   - **Red snackbar** at the bottom of the screen
   - **Console messages** in Xcode (bottom panel)

The error message will tell you exactly what's wrong!
