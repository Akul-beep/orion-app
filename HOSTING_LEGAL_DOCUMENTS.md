# 🌐 Hosting Privacy Policy & Terms of Service

Your app needs **publicly accessible URLs** for Privacy Policy and Terms of Service before App Store submission. Apple requires these URLs to be accessible without login.

## ✅ Files Created

I've created HTML versions of your legal documents:
- `web/privacy-policy.html` - Privacy Policy
- `web/terms-of-service.html` - Terms of Service

## 🚀 Quick Hosting Options

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (FREE - Recommended)

**Steps:**
1. Create a GitHub repository (if you don't have one)
2. Upload the HTML files to the repository
3. Go to repository Settings → Pages

   - `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/privacy-policy.html`
