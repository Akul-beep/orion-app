### 2. ✅ Timeline & How It Works

**Your Scenario:**
- Week 0: Publish app with 30 hardcoded lessons ✅
- Week 2-3: Add lessons 31+ to Supabase
- Week 4+: Users see new lessons automatically!

**How It Actually Works:**
- ✅ App checks Supabase **on every launch** (not after 30 days)
- ✅ If Supabase has lessons → Users see them **immediately**
- ✅ If Supabase empty → Users see 30 hardcoded lessons
- ✅ **No waiting period!** Users get new lessons as soon as you add them

**Example:**
- Day 1: User opens app → Sees 30 hardcoded lessons
- Day 15: You add lesson 31 to Supabase
- Day 15: User opens app → Sees 30 hardcoded + lesson 31 (31 total!)
- Day 20: You add lesson 32 → User sees 32 lessons next time they open app

**It's instant!** No 30-day wait needed. 🎉
