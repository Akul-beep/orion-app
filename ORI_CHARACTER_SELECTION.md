Based on your 9-character grid, I've selected the **4 best ones** for notifications:

### **Selection:**

1. **`ori_friendly.png`** 
   - **#2 Shy/Blushing** (Row 1, Column 2)

   - Perfect for: Daily reminders, learning reminders
   - Warm and approachable!

2. **`ori_concerned.png`** 🔥
   - **#8 Angry** (Row 3, Column 2)
   - **THE AGGRESSIVE ONE** - steam coming from head!
   - Perfect for: Streak at risk (Duolingo-style aggressive!)
   - This will make users come back! 😤

3. **`ori_excited.png`**
   - **#1 Happy/Energetic** (Row 1, Column 1)
   - The one jumping/dancing with tongue out
   - Perfect for: Achievements, level ups, badge unlocks
   - Super energetic and fun! 🎉
